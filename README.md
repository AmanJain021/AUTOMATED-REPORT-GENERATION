This project showcases the implementation of an Automated Report Generation System using Python, designed to read, analyze, and summarize data from multiple file formats and output the results into a well-structured PDF report. The core objective of the task is to automate the process of reading structured data from sources like CSV, Excel,TXT and JSON files can include more in future, perform basic analysis such as statistical summaries, data profiling, and visualizations, and present the output in a neatly formatted PDF using Python libraries like FPDF. This solution minimizes the need for manual report preparation, enhances productivity, and ensures data is presented consistently and professionally. The project supports dynamic file handling, allowing users to work with commonly used data formats in business environments. The implemented script first detects the file type and loads the data using pandas, which enables efficient data manipulation and statistical calculations. Depending on the file content, it calculates metrics like count, mean, min, max, and unique value distribution across numerical and categorical fields. Visual representations such as bar charts or histograms are optionally generated using matplotlib to add value and clarity to the analysis.To produce the final report, the project uses FPDF, a Python library capable of generating PDFs with custom text, layout formatting, and embedded images such as plots and logos. The PDF report includes sections such as a cover page with a title and generation timestamp, a summary of the dataset’s contents (including column descriptions and sample rows), and sections for key insights or visualizations. The layout is simple, readable, and professional, making it suitable for use in academic presentations, corporate meetings, or internal data audits. In addition to FPDF, the implementation is modular enough to switch to ReportLab if more complex formatting or page management is required, depending on future needs.This project was developed using Python 3.13.5 in Visual Studio Code (VS Code) as the preferred editor, utilizing a virtual environment for package isolation and reproducibility. The script is structured to accept input paths dynamically, which allows it to be integrated into larger automation pipelines or GUI-based desktop tools later. The versatility of this solution makes it applicable across industries where regular data reporting is necessary—such as finance, healthcare, sales, education, and logistics. It can be extended to include email automation, multi-page reports, or cloud integration for a fully automated workflow.From a learning and development perspective, this project teaches key concepts such as file I/O, conditional logic, statistical analysis, data visualization, and PDF generation. It reinforces how different Python libraries can work together to solve real-world automation tasks. The final Project include the Python script (report_generator.py), sample input file in CSV format (CSV, Excel, JSON, TXT) other from specified can also be used, the generated PDF report (sample_report.pdf), and a requirements.txt file to simplify environment setup. Overall, this project demonstrates how Python can be effectively used to automate tedious reporting processes, ensure consistent data presentation, and deliver polished, ready-to-share documents — making it a valuable skill set for both technical and non-technical professionals.
